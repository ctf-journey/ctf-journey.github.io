      <description>What are Linked List? Linked Lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science They consist of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence Head is the first node and tail is the last node in the linked list This structure allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion of elements Related examples Read my solution to some LeetCode problems below Reverse Linked List Reorder List https://docs.</description>

      <description>What are Sliding Window? Sliding Window technique is a common algorithm used in various problem-solving scenarios, particularly in computer science It involves maintaining a window of a fixed size that slides over a data structure, typically an array or string As the window moves, calculations or comparisons are made within the current window to find specific patterns, subarrays, or optimal solutions Related examples Read my solution to some LeetCode problems below Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters https://docs.</description>

      <description>What is Binary Search? Binary Search is a search algorithm that efficently finds the position of the target value in a sorted array (Must be sorted!!) It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or determined to be not present Time complexity is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array This makes binary search very efficient for large datasets Related examples Read my solution to some LeetCode problems below Binary Search Search a 2D Matrix https://docs.</description>

      <description>What is Two Pointers? Two Pointers is a technique used to iterate through a data structure, usually an array or linked list These pointers perform tasks such as searching, sorting or finding specific patterns within the data Related examples Read my solution to some LeetCode problems below Valid Palindrome Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OiEYxC6jXoZMtXaA2dt_krmBJ3YsWWykUzuC_4D4DXg/edit?usp=sharing Resources Concepts explained here are following those from Neetcode&amp;rsquo;s roadmap

      <description>What are Stacks? Stacks are a type of data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle Last element to be added is the first to be removed Related examples Read my solution to some LeetCode problems below Valid Parentheses Min Stack https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OiEYxC6jXoZMtXaA2dt_krmBJ3YsWWykUzuC_4D4DXg/edit?usp=sharing Resources Concepts explained here are following those from Neetcode&amp;rsquo;s roadmap

      <description>What are Arrays? Ordered collection of elements Each element has an index, starting from 0 [&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;b&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;c&amp;quot;] - key for a is 0, b is 1 etc What are Hashes? Unordered collection of key-value pairs Each value is retrieved from their corresponding keys Implemented with dictionaries or maps { name: &amp;quot;Alice&amp;quot; } - key is name and value is &amp;quot;Alice&amp;quot; Related examples Read my solution to some LeetCode problems below Contains Duplicate Group Anagrams https://docs.</description>
